1 - Warning - Dev Mode
This warning appears on Dev Mode.
"Can't perform a React state update on an unmounted component. This is a no-op, but it indicates a memory leak in your application. To fix, cancel all subscriptions and asynchronous tasks in a useEffect cleanup function."

It seems to be be related to Apollo Client useQuery and the use of  React Strict Mode in next.config.js:
